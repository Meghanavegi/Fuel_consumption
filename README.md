# Fuel_consumption
The attributes of given dataseta are:
Model Year: The year of the vehicle model.
Make: The manufacturer or brand of the vehicle.
Model: The specific model name of the vehicle.
Vehicle Class: The category or type of vehicle (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck).
Engine Size (L): The displacement size of the vehicle's engine in liters.
Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual).
Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., gasoline, diesel).
Fuel Consumption (City) (L/100 km): The fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers for city driving conditions.
Fuel Consumption (Hwy) (L/100 km): The fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers for highway driving conditions.
Fuel Consumption (Comb) (L/100 km): The combined fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers (city and highway).
Fuel Consumption (Comb) (mpg): The combined fuel consumption rate in miles per gallon (mpg).
CO2 Emissions (g/km): The carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer emitted by the vehicle.
CO2 Rating: The rating or score based on the vehicle's CO2 emissions.
Smog Rating: The rating or score based on the vehicle's smog emissions.

When working with this dataset for machine learning tasks such as regression (e.g., predicting CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption), you would typically use a subset of these columns as features (input variables) and target variables (output variable) for model training and evaluation.

For example, you might use Fuel Consumption (Comb) (L/100 km) as a feature to predict CO2 Emissions (g/km) using regression techniques. Additionally, feature engineering and preprocessing steps may be applied to transform and prepare the data for modeling purposes.
